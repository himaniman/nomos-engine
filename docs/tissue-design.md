# Design note — `tissue`: a small genome unfolded into a big brain

Status: STARTED 2026-11-11. This note holds what was agreed with the user and what each
exam is expected to show BEFORE it is run. Results go to `docs/lab-journal.md`.

## Why a restart

The user's read of the project (2026-11-11), which the record supports: the evolving
brains of vivarium/aqua got better by growing their PERCEPTRONS, not their tissue. In the
saved pools rule depth sits at its cap (4), hidden width went 16 -> 23-32 (cap 32), cell
types 4 of 4, while cells stayed at 48-55 of 144; depth and width were free, cells cost
energy. Later measurements said the same from the inside: the foragers of `cortex` went
through innate arcs that bypassed the sheet (2026-09-14), and 81% of a sheet's change was
shared by all cells while the read-out averaged them (2026-11-05). Sensors were broadcast
to every cell and the command was a mean, so cells were interchangeable and the only place
to put capacity was the perceptron.

The idea itself (cells with perceptrons of several kinds, axons beyond neighbours, growth
from a genotype) was built once as `cortex/brain.py` and failed for measured reasons: a
selection that could not hear (one genome's spread across worlds 67 > the spread between
its children 48), every A/B at n = 2. So what changes now is the METHOD, not the list.

## The claim

**The same genome, grown bigger, is smarter.** A genome holds rules only: how a cell of
each type computes, how a wire changes, who connects to whom. It is a few hundred numbers
at any brain size. Everything an individual knows lives in the states of its cells and
wires, and those multiply with size. That is the mechanism by which growth must pay.

Three signs, each with the control that could deny it:

| sign | measured as | control |
|---|---|---|
| smarter by growing | one genome, more cells -> a better score, at sizes its search never saw | an ordinary net (GRU) on the same exam |
| memory | the answer depends on what is no longer on the senses | freeze or wipe cell/wire state -> falls to the no-memory level |
| thinking | a harder question needs more inner ticks; the brain says when it is done | cut it short -> wrong |

## Decided with the user (2026-11-11)

1. The goal is research: growth that pays, explicit memory, a visible thinking process.
   The game is a later showcase on the same kernel, not the measuring instrument.
2. Gradient descent may search for the genome if it gives results. Learning within a life
   stays local: a wire sees only the two cells it joins.
3. The perceptron inside a cell is small and FIXED. Capacity grows only by cells and wires.
4. Size is a dial first (grow to M and look). An organism that decides its own growth
   comes last.
5. Exams before worlds: abstract tasks, milliseconds per life, known floor and ceiling.
6. Python first. Rust only for a kernel that has stopped changing, checked bit for bit
   against the Python one. The user's pve host (one free socket: 20 threads, 56 GB, no
   GPU) is for breadth, many seeds for days, not for speed.

## Working rules

- One mechanism per step. The next one waits for a number on at least 3 seeds.
- The bar and my prediction are written here before the run; the journal says met or not.
- Every mechanism has an off-switch, and its ablation is run when it is added.
- A size the search never saw is the only evidence of growth. Trained sizes prove nothing.
- What is by hand and what was found is stated for every result.

## The ladder

| rung | adds | exam | stop if |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | plastic wires, one local rule shared by all | associative memory: pairs held vs size | the found rule does not carry to unseen sizes |
| 1 | recurrence: plastic wires among interneurons, taught by no teacher; the senses go silent and the brain runs on its own wires | links A->B, B->C seen apart, asked A->C: hops followed vs ticks, load and size | more ticks do not buy longer chains |
| 2 | wiring from the genome: cell types with affinity, axons by distance | the same exams against random and shuffled wiring | shuffling the wires costs nothing |
| 3 | growth from a seed, size chosen by the organism under a cost | the same exams, with the size it chose | it grows to the cap or not at all |

A map of places is a set of learned chains, so rung 1 is also the road back to an agent in
a world: a map that was learned, not painted by hand as in the atlas.

## Kernel v0 (`tissue/kernel.py`)

Three cell types: S sensory (carry the cue), I interneurons (M of them, the size dial),
O motor (hear the teacher, are read as the answer). Two blocks of wires: S->I innate
(random in every individual, the genome sets only a gain), I->O plastic (start at zero).
Every cell of a type carries the same perceptron, 8 hidden units. A tick, synchronous:
each dendrite AVERAGES its block of wires; the perceptron says the cell's activity and a
learning signal; a plastic wire changes by (source activity) x (target's learning signal).
The genome is 76 numbers.

By hand: the types, the blocks, the average on a dendrite, the product form of the wire
rule. Found: what an interneuron says about its input (its code), what a motor cell does
with its dendrite and the teacher (its answer and its learning signal), the input gain.

## Exam 0: associative memory (`tissue/assoc.py`)

A life is K random pairs, cue (12 bits) -> answer (4 bits), new in every life. Each pair
is shown once (the teacher on the last tick of the cue), then every cue is asked in a
fresh order. Score: bit accuracy, chance 0.5. Headline: **K90**, pairs held at 90% of bits.

Hand-made memories, nothing searched (`python -m tissue.hand`, 2026-11-11):

| interneurons M | hebb | delta, one pass | least squares (not local) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 4.3 | 5.9 | 12.0 |
| 16 | 7.4 | 8.9 | 25.6 |
| 32 | 12.6 | 16.2 | 51.3 |
| 64 | 20.9 | 28.9 | 102.3 |
| 128 | 34.3 | 46.4 | 210.4 |
| 256 | 52.9 | 78.2 | 419.9 |
| 512 | 78.5 | 123.1 | 847.7 |

No interneurons at all (sensory -> motor Hebb): 7.9, so below about 16 interneurons the
tissue is worth less than a direct wire. The local one-pass rules grow about x1.6 per
doubling, not x2: cues live in 12 dimensions, so their codes stay correlated and more
cells do not average that away. Least squares on the same codes is linear in M (1.6 M):
that gap is what a better code or a better rule could win.

### Bars for rung 0, written before the first search

Search: sizes 8-64, 1/8 to 2 pairs per interneuron, 6000 steps, 3 seeds. Exam: 8-512.

- **B1, control.** Plastic wires frozen: accuracy within 0.5 +- 0.03 at every size, at 4
  pairs and more.
- **B2, growth pays.** On every seed K90 rises at every doubling from 8 to 512, and K90
  at 512 is at least 2.5x K90 at 64. (Hand delta: x4.3. A rule that stops at its trained
  sizes: x1.)
- **B3, the rule is worth finding.** On every seed, at every size from 16 up, K90 is at
  least hand Hebb's.
- GRU (64 and 256 hidden, trained on 1-64 pairs): its K90 is reported beside these. No bar.

My prediction: B1 met. The search finds an error-correcting rule and lands within 20% of
hand delta at 8-64. At 256-512 it falls behind hand delta (K90 per interneuron drops
faster), and B2 is met narrowly or missed at 512. B3 met at trained sizes, open at 512.

**Outcome (journal 2026-11-11):** B2 and B3 met on all seeds, about one pair per
interneuron up to 512. B1 missed by the letter (the bar was tighter than the exam resolves;
the control is exact by a test). The prediction was wrong: the search found a hash-like
code and beat hand delta 1.4-3.7x.

## Kernel v1: wires among interneurons (`RUNG1` in `tissue/kernel.py`)

One block added: I->I, plastic, from zero. An interneuron's perceptron now reads two
dendrites (innate from the senses, plastic from the other interneurons) and one global
signal, whether the senses are on; it says its activity and a learning signal for its
I->I wires. The wire rule is unchanged: (source activity a tick ago) x (target's learning
signal now). Nothing outside teaches these wires. Genome: 101 numbers.

The first plan for this rung fed the motor answer back to the sensory cells over
hand-drawn one-to-one wires. Dropped before building: wires among interneurons are the
tissue's own recurrence, they need no teacher, they grow as M^2, and they are what rung 2
(wiring from the genome) will have to shape.

By hand: the global senses-on signal, the rest between episodes (cells fall silent, wires
stay), the teacher's timing. Found: when an interneuron follows its senses and when its
own wires, its code, what it learns from.

## Exam 1: links and chains (`tissue/chain.py`)

Items are 12 bits. A link a->b is its own 3-tick episode: a, then b (the teacher shows the
motor cells `a`), then silence (the teacher shows `b`). The teacher teaches only the ECHO
"say what you just saw"; what follows what is in nobody's signal. Test: the first item for
one tick, then silence; hop h is read at tick h + 2. K = links in a life, K90 per hop.

Step 1a is one hop (single links). Step 1b is chains: links of a chain shown apart, in
random order, asked several hops down.

Hand-made hop (`python -m tissue.hand --hop`): threshold codes, delta rule on the I->I
wires, the recalled code cleaned by the same threshold, a delta-rule decoder.

| M | hand delta, one pass | least squares (not local) |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | 4.0 | 7.3 |
| 16 | 7.7 | 19.8 |
| 32 | 12.5 | 48.7 |
| 64 | 24.8 | 113.6 |
| 128 | 47.7 | 270.8 |
| 256 | 98.5 | 598.1 |

### Bars for step 1a, written before the search

Search: sizes 8-64, 1/8 to 1 link per interneuron, single links only, 6000 steps, 3 seeds.

- **C1, control.** I->I wires frozen: hop-1 accuracy within 0.5 +- 0.03 at 16 links and
  more, every size. (By a test, every walk then says the same thing whatever it began from.)
- **C2, growth pays.** On every seed K90 at hop 1 rises at every doubling from 8 to 512,
  and K90 at 512 is at least 2.5x K90 at 64.
- **C3, worth finding.** On every seed K90 is at least the hand delta hop's at 16-256.

My prediction: C1 met. K90 0.4-0.8 per interneuron at 8-64, above the hand hop. The loss
at 512 is larger than on rung 0 (a recalled code is noisier than a seen one and the
decoder was taught on seen ones): K90(512) / K90(64) between 4 and 6. The code turns less
hash-like and more two-level than on rung 0, because a recalled code has to be cleaned.

A question, no bar: the genome that only ever saw single links, examined on chains of 4.
I expect hop 2 well above chance and a steep fall after: at M/4 links, hop 1 above 0.97,
hop 2 about 0.85, hop 4 about 0.65.

**Outcome (journal 2026-11-11):** one seed of three found the hop; two settled on a
constant code that says the bitwise majority of everything that ever came second. On the
seed that worked: C1 met, C2 met narrowly (x2.8; per interneuron 0.74 at 64, 0.26 at 512),
C3 met (and below the hand hop at 512). It stored both the links and the decoder with the
sign turned over, which cancels for one hop and alternates along a chain: hop 2 is right
in 3-16% of the bits, hop 3 in 78-98%.

### Step 1a', the echo is scored: bars written before the search

One change, to the exam and not to the brain: the echo of the first item (hop 0) joins the
error and the score. It is the one thing the teacher teaches, and it was never checked. A
constant code cannot echo, and a decoder with its sign turned over cannot either. Search as
before, 5 seeds.

- **D1, the search is reliable.** Every seed holds links: K90 at hop 1 above zero at every
  size from 16 up.
- **D2 = C2** (growth), on every seed.
- **D3, the hop composes.** The same genomes, never shown a chain, on chains of 4 at M/4
  links: hop 2 at least 0.8 at sizes 16-128, on every seed.

My prediction: 4 or 5 seeds of 5 leave the plateau (another flat spot may exist: echo
right, hop still the majority). D3 met wherever D1 is. K90 per interneuron no better than
this run's good seed, and the fall at 256-512 stays.

**Outcome (journal 2026-11-11, night):** D1, D2, D3 met on five seeds of five, the
prediction held. Links per interneuron 0.68-0.74 at 64, 0.34-0.40 at 512. A chain of 4
never shown is walked without the sign alternating; depth of a walk grows only weakly
with size. A lesson for every later exam: score what the teacher teaches.

## Where the ladder stands

| rung | state |
|---|---|
| 0 pairs | done, 3 seeds: about 1 pair per interneuron to 512 |
| 1a one hop through own wires | done, 5 seeds: 0.7 links per interneuron at 64, fading to 0.35 at 512 |
| 1b search on chains | next |
| 1c the brain says when it is done | after 1b |
| 2 wiring from the genome | not started |
| 3 growth from a seed | not started |

Open questions carried along: why capacity per interneuron fades beyond the searched sizes
on rung 1 (rung 0 did not fade); why echo capacity stops growing near 128 cells.
